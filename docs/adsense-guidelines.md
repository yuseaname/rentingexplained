# AdSense Guidelines

## Core Principle
User trust and utility come first. Ads are secondary and must never block or delay core content.

## Allowed Placement
- After meaningful content
- Between sections of long articles
- Near conclusions or recap sections
- After tool results (never before inputs or results)

## Forbidden Placement
- Before the main content
- Inside tools in a way that blocks inputs or results
- Deceptive placements (ads that look like navigation or buttons)
- Auto-playing media
- Aggressive sticky ads or interstitials

## Implementation Rules
- Ads must be optional, modular, and removable
- No gating of content or tools
- Avoid excessive density that harms readability
- Respect Core Web Vitals and page speed

## UX Safeguards
- Do not interrupt reading flow
- Keep spacing clear and labels unambiguous
- Prioritize accessibility and mobile usability
