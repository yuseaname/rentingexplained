### XIV. FAQ Section (Schema-Ready)

1. **How much should I budget for my first apartment?**
   
   Budget at least 3-4x your monthly rent for move-in costs. For a $1,200/month apartment, expect $4,500-5,500 first month (deposits, fees, essentials). For ongoing monthly budget, use the 30% rule: rent shouldn't exceed 30% of gross income.

2. **What furniture do I absolutely need for my first apartment?**
   
   Bare essentials: bed/air mattress, 1 pot/pan, basic dishes, shower curtain, towels, and cleaning supplies. You can survive with folding chairs and floor seating initially. Prioritize sleep comfort first, then gradually add furniture over 2-3 months.

3. **Can I live in an empty apartment and buy things slowly?**
   
   Yes! Millions of renters start with air mattresses and camping chairs. Buy survival essentials day one (bedding, shower curtain, basic dishes), then add comfort items over 1-3 months as budget allows. This prevents credit card debt.

4. **What should I buy used vs. new?**
   
   Buy used: Furniture (couches, tables, dressers), small appliances (microwaves, coffee makers), dishes/cookware, lamps, storage bins. Buy new: Mattresses, pillows, towels, shower curtains, anything touching skin/intimate use. Inspect all used items for bed bugs and damage.

5. **How can I furnish my first apartment on $500 or less?**
   
   Use Facebook Marketplace and Buy Nothing groups for free/cheap furniture, buy basics at Dollar Tree, get used appliances, use air mattress temporarily, borrow from family. Prioritize survival items month one, add comfort items months 2-3. See our $800 "Bare Essentials" tier above.

6. **Do landlords provide furniture?**
   
   No, most apartments are unfurnished. Landlord typically provides: major appliances (stove, fridge), smoke detectors, and window blinds. You provide: All furniture, kitchenware, linens, decor, and small appliances. Check your lease for specifics—some include washer/dryer or microwave.
