      <h2 id="introduction">Why Tenant Rights Matter</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Most renter problems get worse when expectations are unclear. Knowing your rights helps you avoid bad lease terms, push for repairs, and protect your deposit without turning every issue into a fight.

      <h2 id="habitability">Right to a Habitable Home</h2>
      <p>
        A rental must be safe and livable. If basic systems fail, the landlord typically must fix them within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>

      <h3>What habitability usually includes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Working heat and hot water.</li>
        <li>Functional plumbing and electricity.</li>
        <li>Secure doors and windows.</li>
        <li>Reasonable protection from pests and mold.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If repairs are ignored</h3>
      <p>
        Put the issue in writing and keep records. Many states require specific steps before you can withhold rent or end a lease, so check local rules first. If you are unsure, the{' '}

        </a>
        {' '}can help you spot repair clauses and notice rules.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Right to Privacy and Quiet Enjoyment</h2>
      <p>
        Landlords usually must give advance notice before entering your unit, except in emergencies. The specific notice window depends on your state.
      </p>

      <h3>What to do if entry rules are ignored</h3>
      <p>
        Ask for future entries to be scheduled in writing and reference your lease terms. If it continues, document each incident and look up your local rules.
      </p>

      <h2 id="deposit">Security Deposit Protections</h2>
      <p>
        Most states set limits on what can be deducted and how quickly deposits must be returned. The best defense is documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Protect your deposit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do a move-in checklist and take photos.</li>
        <li>Save receipts for any repairs you pay for.</li>
        <li>Request a move-out walkthrough when possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="discrimination">Protection from Discrimination</h2>
      <p>
        Federal and state laws prohibit housing discrimination. If you suspect discrimination, keep notes and screenshots, and contact local housing resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Common protected categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Race, color, or national origin.</li>
        <li>Religion.</li>
        <li>Sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</li>
        <li>Disability and familial status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="retaliation">Protection from Retaliation</h2>
      <p>
        In many states, a landlord cannot retaliate against you for reporting code violations or requesting repairs. If you are worried about retaliation, document every interaction and follow the process in writing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="lease-terms">Lease Clauses That Deserve a Second Look</h2>
      <p>
        Some clauses are unenforceable even if they are in the lease. Examples include waiving basic habitability rights or allowing entry without notice. If a clause feels extreme, ask for clarification in writing.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2 id="state-specific">State-Specific Differences</h2>
      <p>
        Tenant rights vary by state and city. For example, some places have stronger repair-and-deduct rules or tighter deposit timelines. Use the{' '}
