      <h2 id="introduction">Why Tenant Rights Matter</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Most renter problems get worse when expectations are unclear. Knowing your rights helps you avoid bad lease terms, push for repairs, and protect your deposit without turning every issue into a fight.

        This guide is general information, not legal advice. If you need your state rules, start with the{' '}

      <h2 id="what-rights-cover">What Tenant Rights Cover (In Plain Language)</h2>
      <p>
        Tenant rights are the basic protections that set expectations for safety, privacy, repairs, and fair treatment. These rights come from state and local laws, and in some cases from federal rules. Your lease can add details, but it usually cannot remove core protections.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Safe, livable housing with working essential systems.</li>
        <li>Reasonable privacy and notice for entry.</li>
        <li>Clear rules around deposits, fees, and move-out timelines.</li>
        <li>Protection from discrimination and retaliation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use This Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Use this page as a starting point for questions to ask and topics to research. If a section seems relevant to your lease, write down the clause and compare it to your state or city rules. This helps you stay factual, calm, and organized.

      <h2 id="habitability">Right to a Habitable Home</h2>
      <p>
        A rental must be safe and livable. If basic systems fail, the landlord typically must fix them within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>

      <h3>What habitability usually includes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Working heat and hot water.</li>
        <li>Functional plumbing and electricity.</li>
        <li>Secure doors and windows.</li>
        <li>Reasonable protection from pests and mold.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If repairs are ignored</h3>
      <p>
        Put the issue in writing and keep records. Many states require specific steps before you can withhold rent or end a lease, so check local rules first. If you are unsure, the{' '}
        <a href="/tools/lease-red-flag-scanner" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">
          Lease Reflex manual checklist
        </a>
        {' '}can help you spot repair clauses and notice rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practical tip: keep a simple repair log with dates, photos, and the exact words used in your requests. If you ever need to explain what happened, a clear timeline helps more than long arguments.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacy">Right to Privacy and Quiet Enjoyment</h2>
      <p>
        Landlords usually must give advance notice before entering your unit, except in emergencies. The specific notice window depends on your state.
      </p>

      <h3>What to do if entry rules are ignored</h3>
      <p>
        Ask for future entries to be scheduled in writing and reference your lease terms. If it continues, document each incident and look up your local rules.
      </p>

      <h2 id="fees">Fees, Rent Increases, and Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Some disputes start with fees or changes that were not clearly explained. A good lease should show what is fixed for the term and what can change. If a fee is not listed, ask where it comes from and when it can be charged.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask for a written fee schedule and keep it with your lease.</li>
        <li>Clarify the notice required for rent increases or renewals.</li>
        <li>Keep communication in writing whenever possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="deposit">Security Deposit Protections</h2>
      <p>
        Most states set limits on what can be deducted and how quickly deposits must be returned. The best defense is documentation.
      </p>

      <h3>Protect your deposit</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do a move-in checklist and take photos.</li>
        <li>Save receipts for any repairs you pay for.</li>
        <li>Request a move-out walkthrough when possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you can, send a short move-in note with your photos so there is a clear record of the unit condition on day one. Keep the message polite and factual.
      </p>

      <h2 id="discrimination">Protection from Discrimination</h2>
      <p>
        Federal and state laws prohibit housing discrimination. If you suspect discrimination, keep notes and screenshots, and contact local housing resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Common protected categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Race, color, or national origin.</li>
        <li>Religion.</li>
        <li>Sex, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</li>
        <li>Disability and familial status.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="retaliation">Protection from Retaliation</h2>
      <p>
        In many states, a landlord cannot retaliate against you for reporting code violations or requesting repairs. If you are worried about retaliation, document every interaction and follow the process in writing.
      </p>

      <h2 id="lease-terms">Lease Clauses That Deserve a Second Look</h2>
      <p>
        Some clauses are unenforceable even if they are in the lease. Examples include waiving basic habitability rights or allowing entry without notice. If a clause feels extreme, ask for clarification in writing.

      <h2 id="state-specific">State-Specific Differences</h2>
