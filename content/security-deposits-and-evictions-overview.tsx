      <h2 id="introduction">Why These Topics Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Security deposits and evictions are two of the most stressful moments in a renter’s journey. They can also be the
        most misunderstood. This guide gives a high-level overview so you can understand the process and prepare ahead
        of time. It is not legal advice, and it does not replace local rules or professional guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your state-specific rules, start with the{' '}

      <h2 id="deposits">Security Deposits: The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        A security deposit is money held to cover unpaid rent or damage beyond normal wear and tear. Many disputes happen
        because the condition of the unit was not documented well at move-in or move-out.
      </p>

      <h3>Typical deposit rules (varies by state)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How much a landlord can collect up front.</li>
        <li>How quickly the deposit must be returned after move-out.</li>
        <li>Whether an itemized list of deductions is required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Normal wear vs. damage (plain language)</h3>
      <p>
        Normal wear is the small, expected changes that happen over time, like minor scuffs or faded paint. Damage is
        usually something broken, missing, or unusually stained. The exact definitions vary, which is why photos and a
        clear move-in checklist matter.
      </p>

      <h3>Documentation habits that help</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete a move-in checklist and take photos on day one.</li>
        <li>Store photos with clear file names and dates.</li>
        <li>Keep receipts for cleaning or repairs you pay for.</li>
        <li>Send a short, polite move-in note with photos attached.</li>
      </ul>

        .
      </p>

      <h2 id="move-out">Move-Out and Return Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        Many states require landlords to return the deposit within a specific number of days. If deductions are made,
        they may need to be itemized. If you receive a deduction that you do not understand, ask for an explanation in
        writing and keep your response calm and factual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Move-out is also the time to mirror your move-in photos. Try to take photos from the same angles and note any
        cleaning or repairs you completed.
      </p>
      <h3>Move-out documentation checklist</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Final photos of every room and close-ups of any wear.</li>
        <li>A short note summarizing what was cleaned or repaired.</li>
        <li>Proof of key return or move-out date.</li>
        <li>Your forwarding address in writing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="disputes">Common Deposit Disputes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cleaning fees without photos or itemized notes.</li>
        <li>Charges for wear that appears to be normal use.</li>
        <li>Missing or vague descriptions of damage.</li>
        <li>Late return of the deposit without explanation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a dispute arises, keep your tone polite and focus on facts, dates, and documentation. Avoid making threats or
        assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple approach is to ask for the itemized list and compare it against your photos. If something looks off,
        respond with a short, factual note and attach the relevant photos.
      </p>

      <h2 id="evictions">Evictions: A Plain-Language Overview</h2>
      <p>
        An eviction is a legal process that usually involves a notice, a chance to respond, and a court decision. The
        exact steps and timing depend on your location. Evictions can move quickly in some places, so it helps to know
        the basic flow.
      </p>

      <h3>Typical eviction steps (general overview)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Notice: The landlord gives a written notice stating the issue and a deadline.</li>
        <li>Response period: Some notices allow time to fix the issue or move out.</li>
        <li>Filing: If the issue is not resolved, a court case may be filed.</li>
        <li>Hearing: Both sides can present information to a judge.</li>
        <li>Outcome: If the landlord wins, the court issues a judgment.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This is a general overview. Do not assume these steps or timelines apply to your area. Always check local rules.
      </p>

      <h3>Common reasons for eviction notices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nonpayment of rent.</li>
        <li>Lease violations, such as unauthorized occupants or pets.</li>
        <li>End of lease term with proper notice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="alternatives">Possible Alternatives to Eviction (General Information)</h2>
      <p>
        Many situations are resolved before court through communication or agreements. This depends on your landlord and
        local rules, but it can include payment plans, written move-out timelines, or lease changes. Get any agreement in
        writing and keep copies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="prevention">How to Reduce Risk (General Guidance)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pay rent on time and keep proof of payment.</li>
        <li>Notify the landlord promptly if there is a serious repair issue.</li>
        <li>Keep copies of notices, emails, and photos.</li>
        <li>Ask for clarity in writing if you receive a notice you do not understand.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">Quick FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Can a landlord keep my deposit for normal wear?</h3>
      <p>
        Many states do not allow deposits to be used for normal wear, but the definition can vary. Photos from move-in
        and move-out are the best way to show the condition fairly.
      </p>
      <h3>Does an eviction notice mean I am evicted?</h3>
      <p>
        A notice is often the first step, not the final outcome. The rest of the process depends on local rules and any
        actions taken by both parties.
      </p>

      <h2 id="when-to-get-help">When to Seek Local Help</h2>
      <p>
        If you receive a notice or have an urgent dispute, seek local tenant resources or professional guidance. Many
        cities have tenant hotlines or legal aid organizations that can explain your local rules.
      </p>
