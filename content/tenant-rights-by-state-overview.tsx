      <h2 id="introduction">Why State Differences Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Two renters can sign very similar leases and still have different rights simply because they live in different
        states. Lease language is important, but local law fills in the gaps for repairs, deposits, notice periods, and
        eviction timelines. Knowing where rules come from helps you understand which parts of your lease are flexible and
        which parts are fixed by law.

      <h2 id="what-varies">What Changes Most Often by State</h2>
      <p>
        While the big themes are similar across the country, the details can vary a lot. These are the areas where
        renters usually see the biggest state-by-state differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of state law as the baseline. Cities and counties can add more protections, but they usually cannot remove
        core rights. That is why the same lease clause can be treated differently depending on where you live.
      </p>
      <h3>Security deposits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum deposit amounts (some states cap it, others do not).</li>
        <li>Deadlines for returning the deposit after move-out.</li>
        <li>Rules for itemized deductions and required receipts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Entry notice and privacy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How much notice a landlord must give before entering.</li>
        <li>Whether notice must be in writing or can be verbal.</li>
        <li>Limits on entry frequency and reasons for entry.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Repairs and habitability</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>What counts as a habitability issue.</li>
        <li>How quickly repairs must be made.</li>
        <li>When (or if) repair-and-deduct is allowed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Eviction timelines and notices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Required notice length for nonpayment or lease violations.</li>
        <li>Whether a landlord can use “cure or quit” notices.</li>
        <li>How quickly an eviction can move through the courts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="who-sets">Who Sets Tenant Rights Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Most tenant protections come from state law. Federal rules cover discrimination and a few specific protections,
        while local governments may add layers for rent increases, eviction notices, or relocation assistance. When
        researching a rule, note where it comes from so you can find the most current source.
      </p>

      <h2 id="misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“My lease says it, so it must be legal.” Not always. Some rights cannot be waived.</li>
        <li>“All states have the same notice rules.” Notice periods vary widely.</li>
        <li>“A fee is fine if it is called a deposit.” Labels matter in many states.</li>
        <li>“Local rules only apply to big cities.” Some smaller towns have their own ordinances too.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="local">Local Rules Can Add More Protections</h2>
      <p>
        Many large cities and counties add additional renter protections. These can include stronger notice
        requirements, relocation assistance, or rules about rent increases. If you live in a major metro area, check
        your city or county housing department as well as your state resources.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rent-control">Rent Control and Stabilization</h2>
      <p>
        Rent control policies are local, not universal. Some states allow cities to set rent caps, while others ban them
        entirely. If you are in a rent-controlled area, there may be special rules about how rent can increase and how
        leases can be renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your lease mentions rent control or stabilization, confirm the local rules before signing. Policies change,
        and you want to be sure the lease matches current law.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-check">How to Find Your State and City Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Start with official sources. These are typically the most reliable and are updated when laws change. Look for
        state or city housing departments, attorney general resources, or court websites that publish tenant guides.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>State housing department or consumer protection office.</li>
        <li>City or county housing department (especially in large metros).</li>
        <li>Local legal aid organizations with renter guides.</li>
        <li>Public law libraries or self-help court resources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="recordkeeping">A Simple Recordkeeping Checklist</h2>
      <p>
        Regardless of state, good records make disputes easier to resolve. Keep your lease, payment proof, photos, and
        written communications together in a single folder.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save your signed lease and all addendums.</li>
        <li>Keep move-in photos and a condition checklist.</li>
        <li>Store all repair requests and responses in one thread.</li>
        <li>Document any notices you receive with dates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="lease">How to Compare Your Lease to Local Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Use your lease as a checklist. Highlight any section that touches deposits, entry, repairs, or fees. Then compare
        those clauses with your local rules. If something seems inconsistent, write down the exact clause and ask for
        clarification in writing. The goal is to remove confusion, not to argue.
      </p>

      <h2 id="questions">Questions to Ask (Not Legal Advice)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How long does the landlord have to return the security deposit?</li>
        <li>What notice is required for entry and how is it delivered?</li>
        <li>Where should repair requests be sent and how are they tracked?</li>
        <li>Are any fees allowed to change during the lease term?</li>
        <li>What is the notice period for non-renewal or move-out?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">Quick FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Do month-to-month leases have different rules?</h3>
      <p>
        Often, yes. Notice periods for ending a month-to-month lease can be shorter or longer depending on state and
        local rules. Check your local requirements before assuming the standard 30 days applies.
      </p>
      <h3>Can a landlord change rules mid-lease?</h3>
      <p>
        Some rules are fixed for the lease term, while others can change with proper notice. Look for clauses that
        explain how changes are communicated and confirm the local rules.
