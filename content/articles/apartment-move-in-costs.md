<h2 id="move-in-basics">What counts as move-in costs</h2>

Move-in costs are everything you pay before and right after you get the keys. They usually fall into two buckets: one-time payments and early monthly costs.

### One-time costs

These are fees and deposits paid up front. They can include a security deposit, application fees, admin fees, and utility setup deposits.

### Early monthly costs

Your first month of rent is usually due before move-in. You may also see prorated rent or your first utility bills in the same time window.

### Why a checklist matters

Small fees add up fast. A checklist keeps you from forgetting the little charges that can push you over budget.

<h2 id="big-three">The big three payments</h2>

These are the most common and usually the largest up-front costs.

### First month rent and possible prorated rent

Most leases collect the first month before move-in. If you move in mid-month, you might pay a prorated amount for that partial month plus the next full month. Ask for the exact due dates in writing.

### Security deposit basics

Security deposits vary by state and building policy. Some landlords charge a flat amount, while others base it on one month of rent. For a plain-language overview, see [security deposits and evictions](/blog/security-deposits-and-evictions-overview).

Pro tip: Ask for a written receipt for any deposit you pay and store it with your lease. It makes move-out conversations much easier later.

### Last month rent or prepaid rent

Some properties collect last month rent up front, while others do not. Ask whether it is required so you do not get surprised at signing.

<h2 id="checklist">Printable Checklist: Move-In Cost Prep</h2>

### Before you apply
- [ ] Estimate your monthly rent range with the [Rent Budget Checker](/tools/rent-budget-checker)
- [ ] Ask about application and admin fees in writing
- [ ] Confirm whether a holding fee is required
- [ ] Ask if last month rent is collected up front

### Before you sign
- [ ] Get a full fee list (deposit, admin, move-in, pet, parking)
- [ ] Confirm which utilities are included vs billed separately
- [ ] Ask about required renters insurance coverage
- [ ] Get the exact move-in date and any prorated rent

### In your first week
- [ ] Set up utilities and internet
- [ ] Buy only essentials (bed, basic kitchen, cleaning)
- [ ] Save receipts and note return dates
- [ ] Screenshot your move-in condition photos

Tip: Save this page or screenshot this checklist for later.

<h2 id="fees-addons">One-time fees and common add-ons</h2>

After the big three, these are the costs that catch renters off guard. Ask for the full list before you pay anything.

### Application and admin fees

Most properties charge an application fee for screening. Some also charge an admin or processing fee. Ask if any part is refundable.

### Holding or reservation fees

A holding fee may remove the unit from the market while you decide. Ask how long it holds the unit and whether it applies to your move-in costs.

### Move-in, amenity, and package fees

Some buildings charge a move-in fee or a mandatory amenity fee. These are common in larger complexes. Cross-check them with the [hidden rental fees guide](/blog/hidden-rental-fees-explained).

### Pet fees and pet rent

If you have a pet, clarify whether you are paying a one-time deposit, a non-refundable fee, or a monthly pet rent. Ask for the total cost across a year so you can compare options.

### Copy/Paste Template: Fee Breakdown Request

**When to use this:** After a tour or application, when you need a written list of costs.

```text
Subject: Request for Full Move-In Cost Breakdown for [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

Thanks for the tour. Before I move forward, could you please confirm the full list of move-in costs for [Address]?

Please include:
- First month rent and any prorated rent
- Security deposit amount
- Application and admin fees
- Any move-in, amenity, or package fees
- Pet fees or pet rent (if applicable)
- Required renters insurance coverage

A written breakdown will help me finalize my budget.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

**Make it yours:** Keep it short and send it before you pay anything.

<h2 id="utilities-setup">Utilities and setup costs</h2>

Utilities can add a few small charges right away, so ask about them early.

### Utility activation or deposit

Some providers charge a setup fee or require a deposit, especially if you have limited credit history. Ask the property whether you will set up accounts directly or if they use a shared billing system.

### Internet and streaming

Internet setup fees vary by provider. If you work from home, confirm the available providers and install timelines before move-in.
For a deeper breakdown, see the [apartment utility costs guide](/blog/apartment-utility-costs).

### Renters insurance requirement

Many landlords require renters insurance. For a full breakdown, see the [renters insurance cost guide](/blog/renters-insurance-cost-2025). If you plan to compare policies, you can use a renters insurance comparison tool. Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you use this service (at no cost to you).

<h2 id="moving-setup">Moving and setup costs you control</h2>

These costs are more flexible. You can save money by choosing what to buy and when to buy it.

### Moving help

You can move with friends, rent a truck, or hire movers. If you use a moving marketplace or quote service, compare the total cost and reviews first. Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you use this service (at no cost to you).

### Supplies and basic items

Budget for boxes, cleaning supplies, and basic tools. They are cheap individually but add up quickly.

### Start with essentials

Use the [first apartment budget guide](/blog/first-apartment-checklist-budget-guide) to avoid overbuying in week one.

### Example move-in budget

Here is a simple example to show how totals add up. Your numbers will be different.

- First month rent: $1,600
- Security deposit: $1,600
- Application and admin fees: $150
- Utility setup and internet: $200
- Moving and supplies: $350

Total: $3,900

<h2 id="budget-plan">Build a simple move-in budget</h2>

You do not need a complex spreadsheet. Use a two-column list and keep it updated.

### Step 1: Split costs into two columns

- Must pay before keys: deposit, first month, required fees.
- Pay in the first month: utilities, supplies, basic furniture.

### Step 2: Add a small buffer

Add a buffer for unexpected charges. Even a small cushion can prevent a last-minute scramble.

### Step 3: Build a simple move-in timeline

List what must be paid before you get keys, then list what can be paid in the first 30 days. A simple timeline keeps you from buying everything at once and protects your cash flow.

### Step 4: Compare totals with your rent range

If the total is higher than expected, adjust your move-in date, choose a cheaper unit, or delay non-essential purchases.

For a quick total-cost check, compare rent and fees with the [Hidden Fees Estimator](/tools/hidden-fees-estimator).

<h2 id="reduce-costs">How to reduce move-in costs</h2>

You can often lower costs without harming your application. The key is asking early and being specific.

### Ask for fee breakdowns before you apply

Written fee lists help you compare options and reduce surprise charges.

### Negotiate fees or ask for concessions

If the market is soft, you can ask for a waived admin fee or a reduced deposit. Keep requests calm and reasonable. For scripts and timing, see the [rent negotiation guide](/blog/how-to-negotiate-rent-guide).

### Time your move if you have flexibility

Off-season or mid-month move-ins can sometimes come with better terms. If you are flexible, ask about timing options.

### Avoid common mistakes that raise costs

- Paying for amenities you will not use.
- Buying furniture before you measure your space.
- Signing before you have a full fee breakdown in writing.

### Focus on total monthly cost

A lower base rent is not always the best deal. Compare total monthly cost and fees before deciding.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

### How much should I budget for move-in costs?

It depends on your rent, deposit policy, and fees. Start by adding first month rent, deposit, and known fees, then add a small buffer for utilities and supplies.

### Are application fees refundable?

Usually not, but it varies. Ask before you apply so you can compare buildings fairly.

### Can I negotiate my security deposit?

Sometimes, especially if your credit is strong or the market is soft. Ask politely and be ready for a no.

### What if I cannot afford the up-front costs?

Look for lower-fee buildings, consider a later move-in date, or focus on a smaller unit with fewer add-ons.

### Do I need renters insurance before move-in?

Some landlords require proof before keys are handed over. Ask when it must be active so you can time it correctly.
