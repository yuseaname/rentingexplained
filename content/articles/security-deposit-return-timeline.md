<h2 id="timeline-basics">How security deposit return timelines work</h2>

Most states require landlords to return a deposit and an itemized statement within a set timeline. The exact timeline varies by state and sometimes by city.

### Start with your lease

Some leases include specific timelines or instructions for deposit return. Use those as your baseline and compare with your local rules.

### The statement matters

Even if you do not receive a check right away, the itemized statement is key. It explains deductions and gives you a paper trail.

Pro tip: Keep your move-out photos and walkthrough notes in a single folder. It makes follow-up faster.

If you need a big-picture overview, start with [security deposits and evictions](/blog/security-deposits-and-evictions-overview).
Example: Priya moves out on June 30, returns keys on July 1, and sends a forwarding address the same day. She keeps photos and a copy of her notice in one folder so follow-up is simple if needed.

<h2 id="deposit-checklist">Printable Checklist: Deposit protection basics</h2>

### Before you move out

- [ ] Give notice on time using the [notice to vacate template](/blog/notice-to-vacate-letter-template)
- [ ] Schedule a walkthrough if allowed
- [ ] Prepare a folder for photos and receipts

### Move-out day

- [ ] Take room-by-room photos and video
- [ ] Photograph any existing damage
- [ ] Return keys and keep proof
- [ ] Confirm your forwarding address in writing

### After you move

- [ ] Save the deposit statement when it arrives
- [ ] Compare deductions to your photos
- [ ] Follow up if the timeline has passed

Tip: Save this page or screenshot this checklist for later.

<h2 id="before-move-out">Before you move out: set yourself up for a clean return</h2>

A few early steps can make the return process smoother.

### Confirm the walkthrough process

If your landlord does walkthroughs, ask how they document issues and whether you can attend.

### Know your move-out costs

Use the [apartment move-out checklist](/blog/apartment-move-out-checklist) to plan photos, cleaning, and key return without scrambling.
### Update your forwarding address early

Include it in your notice and confirm it again when you return keys. This is one of the most common causes of delays.

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation folder: what to save</h2>

A simple folder keeps everything in one place and makes follow-up easy.

### Save these items

- Your notice to vacate and delivery confirmation
- Move-out photos and walkthrough notes
- Copies of any repair requests or maintenance emails
- Receipts for cleaning or repairs (if you hired help)

### Keep it simple

One folder on your phone or computer is enough. Name files by room so you can find them quickly if a dispute comes up.

<h2 id="delays">What can delay a deposit return</h2>

Delays are common, but you can reduce them by staying organized.

### Missing forwarding address

Landlords need a valid address to send your refund and statement. Provide it in your notice and again at key return.

### Disagreements about condition

If the landlord believes there is damage, they may take longer to gather estimates. Clear photos help reduce disputes.

### Unpaid balances

Outstanding balances or fees can slow down the process. Use [hidden rental fees explained](/blog/hidden-rental-fees-explained) to compare common charges.

Warning: If you are missing paperwork, it becomes harder to challenge deductions later.

<h2 id="find-rules">Where to find your local timeline</h2>

Because timelines vary by state and city, use reliable local sources for the exact rule.

### Start with official resources

Look for state or city housing agencies, consumer protection sites, or tenant guides hosted by local governments. Avoid relying on forums or social posts for legal timelines.

### Compare with your lease

If your lease states a timeline, compare it to the local rule and follow the stricter requirement.

If you need a general orientation, use [tenant rights basics](/blog/tenant-rights-everyone-should-know) and the [state overview guide](/blog/tenant-rights-by-state-overview).

<h2 id="follow-up">How to follow up if your deposit is late</h2>

Start with a short, calm message that includes your move-out date and forwarding address. Keep the tone neutral.

### When to follow up

If the stated timeline has passed, send a written follow-up. If you are unsure about the timeline, check local rules first.

### What to include

- Your move-out date
- The unit address
- Your forwarding address
- A request for the deposit statement and refund

### A simple follow-up sequence

1) Send the written request and save a copy.
2) Wait a few business days for a reply.
3) If needed, send a short second message with the same details.

<h2 id="refund-delivery">How refunds are usually delivered</h2>

Refunds are typically sent by mail or handled through a property portal, depending on your lease and landlord's process.

### Paper checks

Checks are still common. That is why a correct forwarding address matters.

### Electronic refunds

Some landlords use online portals or payment systems. If you used an online payment system during your lease, ask whether refunds are processed the same way.

Pro tip: Keep an eye on your portal messages. Refund notices can be easy to miss.

<h2 id="deadline-tracking">Tracking the deadline: postmark vs received</h2>

One common source of confusion is whether the deadline is based on when the landlord sends the refund or when you receive it. Some jurisdictions allow a refund that is postmarked by the deadline, while others require delivery by a specific date. Your lease may also describe how notices are deemed delivered. This is why checking local rules matters.

### Build a simple timeline

- Note your official move-out date
- Record the date you returned keys
- Save the date you sent your forwarding address
- Mark the deadline from your local rule

If you moved out early, use the actual key return date unless your lease says a different official move-out date.

If your local rule is not clear, ask a local tenant resource to point you to the official language. Keep a screenshot or link in your documentation folder. That way, if you need to follow up, you can reference the rule without guessing.

Pro tip: If you mail a letter, take a photo of the envelope or postmark. It is a simple way to document when you sent a follow-up.

<h2 id="template">Copy/Paste Template: Deposit return follow-up</h2>

**When to use this:** When the timeline has passed and you need a written request.

```text
Subject: Security Deposit Return Follow-Up - [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

I moved out of [Address] on [Move-Out Date] and provided my forwarding address. I have not yet received the security deposit statement or refund.

Could you please confirm the status of the deposit return and the expected delivery date? My forwarding address is:
[Forwarding Address]

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

**Make it yours:** Keep it factual and include your move-out date.

<h2 id="deductions-basics">What landlords can deduct vs normal wear</h2>

Rules vary by location, but most states separate normal wear from damage.

### Normal wear examples

- Minor scuffs on walls
- Faded paint from sunlight
- Light carpet wear in high-traffic areas

### Damage examples

- Large holes in walls
- Broken fixtures or missing keys
- Stains that require replacement

If you are unsure, keep the discussion focused on photos and the itemized statement.
<h2 id="deductions">What to do if deductions look wrong</h2>

You do not need to argue in circles. Start with documentation and a clear request.

### Compare deductions to your records

Match the landlord's list to your photos and walkthrough notes. If a charge looks incorrect, point to the specific photo.

### Ask for receipts or details

It is reasonable to ask for a breakdown of charges if the statement is unclear.

### Consider a calm escalation

If needed, ask for the next step in writing. Keep all communication polite and organized.

If you need help with documentation, use the [move-out checklist](/blog/apartment-move-out-checklist) for a room-by-room plan.

### How long do landlords have to return a security deposit?

Timelines vary by state and city. Check your local rules and your lease for the exact requirement.

### What if I did not provide a forwarding address?

Send it in writing right away. A missing address can delay the return.

### What if the landlord ignores my follow-up?

Send a second written request and keep copies. If needed, consult a local tenant resource.

### Should I dispute deductions right away?

Start by asking for a clear breakdown and receipts if needed. Keep the tone calm and stick to documented facts.

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

Security deposit returns are easier when your documentation is organized and your follow-up is clear. Keep photos, save proof of key return, and send a short request if the timeline passes.
