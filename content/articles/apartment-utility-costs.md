<h2 id="utility-setup">Know your utility setup</h2>

How you are billed changes what you can control. Ask these questions before you move in or at renewal.

### Utilities included in rent

Some buildings include water, trash, or heat. If utilities are included, focus on the add-ons you still pay for, like internet or electricity.

### Submetered utilities

Submetered means you pay for your actual usage. This gives you the most control, but it also means small leaks can raise your bill.

### Shared billing or RUBS

Some properties use a shared billing method where costs are split by unit size or occupancy. If that is the case, focus on the parts you can control and keep a record of any building-wide issues.

### Ask for provider lists and typical ranges

Landlords or property managers often know which providers service the building. Ask for the list and whether they can share typical seasonal ranges for similar units. It is not a guarantee, but it helps you plan.

<h2 id="lease-bills">Read your lease and bills</h2>

You do not need to read every line, but you should know what you are responsible for and when bills are due.

### Check the lease for billing rules

Look for utility responsibility, late fees, and repair reporting requirements. If anything is unclear, ask for a written explanation.

### Review your bill line by line

Look for service fees, late fees, or new add-ons. If a charge looks off, ask the provider for a written breakdown.

### Know what is maintenance vs tenant responsibility

If a broken seal, HVAC issue, or leak is driving costs up, that is often a maintenance request, not a usage problem. Put issues in writing so there is a record.

### Match billing cycles to your budget

If bills land at awkward times, set a reminder so they do not turn into late fees. The [Rent Budget Checker](/tools/rent-budget-checker) can help you map your total monthly cost.

<h2 id="utility-checklist">Printable Checklist: 30-Minute Utility Audit</h2>

### Quick prep
- [ ] Grab your latest utility bills
- [ ] Locate your thermostat and water heater controls
- [ ] Find windows, doors, and vents

### The quick checks
- [ ] Set thermostat to a reasonable range for the season
- [ ] Replace or clean filters if you can access them
- [ ] Check for drafts around doors and windows
- [ ] Look for dripping faucets or running toilets
- [ ] Confirm fridge and freezer seals close tightly

### After the audit
- [ ] Report any leaks or broken seals in writing
- [ ] Track your next bill for changes
- [ ] Save your notes in a single folder

Tip: Save this page or screenshot this checklist for later.

<h2 id="quick-wins">Quick wins that lower bills fast</h2>

These changes take minutes and usually show up in the next bill.

### Adjust heating and cooling

Heating and cooling are often the biggest drivers. Set a stable range and avoid big swings. A small change can be more effective than daily adjustments.

If your building allows it, set a schedule that shifts a few degrees when you sleep or leave. The goal is consistency, not perfection.

### Use LED lighting

Switching to LED bulbs lowers lighting costs and reduces heat from fixtures. If you buy a starter kit, compare reviews first. Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you use this service (at no cost to you).

### Cut standby power

Unplug devices you rarely use or group them on a power strip. Small leaks add up over time.

### Example: Small changes, real impact

Example: A renter who keeps their thermostat stable, switches to LED bulbs, and stops running half-load laundry often sees a lower bill within one or two cycles. The exact amount will vary, but the pattern is consistent.

<h2 id="longer-term">Longer-term habits that stick</h2>

These habits are less about perfection and more about consistency.

### Summer cooling habits

- Use curtains or blinds to block direct sun.
- Run fans to circulate air and reduce AC load.
- Cook during cooler times to avoid extra heat.

### Winter heating habits

- Add a draft stopper to doors.
- Keep vents clear and avoid blocking airflow.
- Wear layers and keep the thermostat steady.

Warning: Portable heaters can raise costs quickly and may be restricted in some buildings. Check your lease before using them.

### Water and laundry habits

- Wash clothes in cold water when possible.
- Run full loads to reduce cycles.
- Take shorter showers and fix drips quickly.

### Cooking and appliance habits

- Use lids on pots and turn burners down once boiling.
- Run the dishwasher when full, not half full.
- Let leftovers cool before refrigerating to reduce fridge load.

<h2 id="seasonal-spikes">Plan for seasonal spikes</h2>

Utility bills often jump in summer and winter. Planning for those months keeps your budget steady.

### Summer cooling costs

If you use AC, expect higher bills in hot months. Start with shade, fans, and steady thermostat settings before you lower the temperature.

### Winter heating costs

Heating can drive bills up quickly. Block drafts, keep vents clear, and avoid turning the heat up and down throughout the day.

### Shoulder seasons

Spring and fall are great times to reset habits, clean filters, and check seals. Small fixes now can prevent a surprise later.

<h2 id="repairs">Repairs and maintenance requests</h2>

If a leak or broken system is driving your bill up, put the request in writing. This is general information, not legal advice.

### What to include

- The issue and when it started.
- How it affects your utility costs.
- A request for repair and timeline.

### Copy/Paste Template: Utility-Related Repair Request

**When to use this:** When a leak, appliance, or HVAC issue is driving higher bills.

```text
Subject: Repair Request for [Issue] at [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

I am requesting a repair for [issue] at [address]. The issue started on [date] and appears to be affecting my utility usage.

Could you please confirm the next step and the expected repair timeline? I am happy to provide access for a technician.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

**Make it yours:** Keep it factual and include dates.

<h2 id="split-disputes">Split utilities and handle disputes</h2>

Roommates and shared billing can cause confusion. A clear plan prevents conflict.

### Choose a simple split method

Common options include equal split, split by bedroom size, or split by income. Pick one method and put it in writing.

### Use a simple reminder system

Set a shared reminder a few days before the due date. A single late fee can erase the savings you worked for.

### Keep a shared record

Use a shared spreadsheet or notes app to track due dates and who paid what.

### Dispute charges early

If a bill looks wrong, ask for a breakdown right away. Keep screenshots of your meter readings if you have access.

<h2 id="tools">Tools that make tracking easier</h2>

A few tools can help you stay consistent without overthinking it.

### Budgeting and bill reminders

A simple budgeting app can keep bills on time and track trends. Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you use this service (at no cost to you).

### Usage tracking

Some utility providers offer free usage dashboards. If yours does not, ask for one or check their website.

### Pro tip: save monthly snapshots

Save a screenshot of your usage graph each month. It makes it easier to spot patterns and explain spikes when they happen.
