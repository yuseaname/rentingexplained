<h2 id="move-in-costs">Add up total move-in costs</h2>

Furniture is only part of the bill. Start with the costs that must be paid before you move in.

### Common move-in costs to plan for

- First month rent.
- Security deposit and possible last month rent.
- Application, admin, or holding fees.
- Utility setup deposits or activation fees.

<h2 id="budget-tier">Choose a budget tier</h2>

Pick a tier that matches your income and timeline. Mixing tiers is how budgets drift.

### Essentials tier

Focus on the minimum you need to live comfortably: a bed, basic kitchen items, and lighting.

### Comfort tier

Add items that improve daily routines, like a small desk, better storage, and upgraded bedding.

### Upgrade tier

Invest in higher-quality pieces once you know the space and plan to stay longer.

<h2 id="room-by-room">Room-by-room budget checklist</h2>

Use this as your baseline list. Skip anything you will not use in the first month.

### Kitchen

- One pot, one pan, and basic utensils.
- Plates, bowls, cups, and silverware.
- Dish soap, sponge, and trash bags.

### Bedroom

- Mattress and bedding.
- A lamp and simple storage.
- Backup sheets or pillowcases.

### Bathroom

- Shower curtain and liner.
- Towels and bath mat.
- Basic cleaning supplies.

### Living room

- Seating you will use daily.
- A small surface for meals or work.
- Lighting that makes the room usable.

### Cleaning and safety basics

- Multi-surface cleaner and trash bags.
- Vacuum or broom, depending on floors.
- A basic tool kit for minor fixes.

<h2 id="used-vs-new">Used vs new: where to save</h2>

Used items can cut costs fast, but not everything should be secondhand.

### Buy used when possible

- Tables, chairs, and storage.
- Lamps and decor.
- Kitchen basics like pots or cutting boards.

### Buy new for health and safety

- Mattress and bedding.
- Towels and basic hygiene items.
- Small appliances if condition is unclear.

<h2 id="buying-timeline">A simple buying timeline</h2>

A timeline protects your budget and keeps the move-in week manageable.

### Month 1: essentials only

Buy the items you need to sleep, cook, and stay clean. Skip upgrades.

### Month 2: comfort items

Add pieces that improve daily routines like a desk, storage, or better lighting.

### Month 3: upgrades

If your budget allows, upgrade furniture or add decor.

<h2 id="track-spending">Track spending without stress</h2>

A simple list beats a complicated spreadsheet. Keep it short and update it once a week.

### Quick tracking steps

- Set a total budget number.
- Track move-in costs and furniture separately.
- Save receipts and note return dates.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

### How much should I spend on my first apartment?

It depends on your income, savings, and timeline. Pick a tier you can afford without stretching your monthly budget.

### Is it better to buy everything at once?

Not usually. Buying in phases keeps costs predictable and helps you learn what you actually need.

### Should I finance furniture?

Only if the payment fits your budget comfortably. Used items and slow upgrades are safer for most renters.

### What if my apartment already includes some furniture?

Subtract those items from your list and spend more on storage, lighting, or kitchen basics instead.
