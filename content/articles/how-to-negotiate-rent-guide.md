Did you know the average renter who successfully negotiates their rent saves **$2,400 per year**? Yet 67% of renters never even ask their landlord for a rent reduction. If you're paying $1,500/month for rent, that's potentially $200/month staying in your pocket instead of your landlord's—money that could fund your emergency savings, pay off debt, or go toward a future down payment.

**The truth is:** Landlords expect negotiation. In fact, 43% of landlords say they're willing to negotiate rent, especially with good tenants. The problem? Most renters don't know *how* to ask, *when* to ask, or *what leverage* they actually have.

This comprehensive guide gives you the exact framework, word-for-word scripts, and timing strategies that rental industry insiders use. Whether you're renewing a lease, moving into a new apartment, or facing an unexpected rent increase, you'll learn how to confidently negotiate and win.

## I. When to Negotiate Rent (Timing Is Everything)

### The Optimal Negotiation Window

Timing can make or break your negotiation. Here's the strategic timeline:

**60-90 Days Before Lease Expiration (BEST)**
- Landlords are most motivated to retain good tenants
- Sufficient time to find replacement if negotiation fails
- Success rate: 58% for rent reduction requests

**30-60 Days Before Expiration (GOOD)**
- Still workable but reduces your leverage
- Shows consideration while maintaining urgency
- Success rate: 42% for rent reduction requests

**During Lease (CHALLENGING)**
- Only viable if you have strong leverage (major repairs needed, market decline)
- Requires exceptional tenant history
- Success rate: 18% for mid-lease reductions

**Upon Move-In for New Apartments (OPPORTUNITY)**
- Before signing, you have maximum leverage
- Landlords prefer filling vacancies quickly
- Success rate: 51% for initial rent negotiation

?? **Pro Tip:** If your lease expires December-February (peak moving season in warm climates), you have less leverage. Consider asking for a lease extension to shift renewal to spring/summer when vacancy rates are higher.

### Market Conditions That Favor Renters

**You have strong leverage when:**

1. **Vacancy rates exceed 7%** in your area (check local housing authority data)
2. **New apartment complexes** recently opened nearby (increased supply)
3. **Economic uncertainty** reduces demand (job market slowdowns)
4. **Off-season timing** (winter in cold climates, summer in college towns)
5. **Your unit type** has high availability (check Zillow, Apartments.com listings)

**How to research your market:**
- [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com) - Local vacancy rates and comparable rent prices
- [Zillow Rental Manager](https://www.zillow.com/rental-manager/) - Market trend data by ZIP code
- Census.gov - Regional economic indicators
- Local housing authority websites - Official vacancy statistics

## II. Build Your Negotiation Foundation (Do This First)

### Strategy 1: Document Your Tenant Value

Landlords value tenants who:
- Pay rent on time (every single month)
- Maintain the property well (no damage, cleanliness)
- Don't generate complaints (quiet, respectful)
- Stay long-term (reduce turnover costs)

**Action Steps:**

1. **Create a Tenant Value Document** (Template):

```
Rent Payment History:
- On-time payments: 24/24 months (100%)
- Zero late fees incurred
- Auto-pay enrolled for reliability

Property Care:
- Routine maintenance I've handled: [List minor repairs]
- Property improvements I've made: [Paint, fixtures, etc.]
- Move-in vs current condition: Improved

Tenure & Reliability:
- Years at property: [X years]
- Lease violations: 0
- Noise/neighbor complaints: 0
- Intent: Willing to sign 18-24 month lease for right price
```

2. **Gather proof:**
   - Bank statements showing consistent rent payments
   - Photos of well-maintained apartment
   - Positive communication history with landlord/property manager

?? **Pro Tip:** Good tenants save landlords $1,500-$3,000 in turnover costs (vacancy loss, cleaning, advertising, showings). Use this in your negotiation: "I understand turnover costs average $2,000+ per unit. I'd like to discuss renewing at a rate that benefits us both."

### Strategy 2: Research Comparable Rents

**This is your most powerful ammunition.**

**Step-by-step market research:**

1. **Identify 5-10 comparable units:**
   - Same ZIP code (ideally within 1 mile)
   - Similar square footage (within 100 sq ft)
   - Same number of bedrooms/bathrooms
   - Similar amenities (parking, laundry, etc.)
   - Currently available (active listings)

2. **Document your findings in a table:**

| Address | Sq Ft | Rent | $/Sq Ft | Amenities | Distance |
|---------|-------|------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 123 Main St | 850 | $1,400 | $1.65 | Pool, Parking | 0.3 mi |
| 456 Oak Ave | 900 | $1,450 | $1.61 | Gym, Parking | 0.7 mi |
| **Your Unit** | **875** | **$1,650** | **$1.89** | **Parking only** | **-** |

3. **Calculate the market average:**
   - Your example: Market average is $1.63/sq ft
   - Your current rent: $1.89/sq ft
   - **You're paying 16% above market = $227/month overpayment**

**Resources to use:**
- Zillow.com/rentals
- Apartments.com
- Craigslist.org (local listings)
- Facebook Marketplace - Housing
- Rent.com

?? **Warning:** Don't use listings older than 30 days (prices change). Only use currently available units (not "rented" ones).

### Strategy 3: Know Your Rights

**Legal protections during rent negotiation:**

**You CANNOT be retaliated against for:**
- Requesting a rent reduction
- Joining a tenants' union
- Reporting code violations
- Requesting necessary repairs

**Landlords CANNOT:**
- Raise rent during your lease term (unless specified in lease)
- Discriminate based on protected classes
- Retaliate within 90-180 days of you exercising tenant rights (varies by state)

**State-specific rent control laws:**
- **California:** Annual increases capped at 5% + inflation (max 10%)
- **New York:** Rent-stabilized units have specific caps
- **Oregon:** Statewide rent control (7% + CPI max increase)
- **New Jersey:** Rent control in many municipalities

## III. The 15 Proven Negotiation Tactics (Ranked by Success Rate)

### Tactic 1: The Long-Term Lease Trade-Off (Success Rate: 73%)

**The Strategy:** Offer to sign a longer lease (18-24 months) in exchange for lower monthly rent.

**Why it works:** Landlords value stability. A guaranteed tenant for 2 years eliminates vacancy risk and turnover costs.

**How to calculate the win-win:**
- Current rent: $1,500/month
- Landlord's turnover cost: ~$2,000 (1 month vacancy + cleaning/repairs)
- Your offer: $1,400/month for 24-month lease
- Landlord saves: $2,000 turnover cost - $2,400 rent reduction = Break-even, but guaranteed cash flow
- You save: $100/month × 24 months = **$2,400 total**

**Word-for-Word Script:**

> "I've really enjoyed living here and would love to continue for another two years. I've researched comparable units in the area [attach research], and I noticed they're renting for $1,400-$1,450. Would you be willing to match the market rate at $1,425/month if I commit to a 24-month lease? This saves you turnover costs and guarantees reliable cash flow."

### Tactic 2: The Repair Credit Exchange (Success Rate: 68%)

**The Strategy:** Identify needed repairs and offer to handle them yourself in exchange for rent credit.

**Best for:** Handy renters, units with visible maintenance needs

**How to implement:**

1. **Document needed repairs:**
   - Leaky faucets, worn caulking, paint touch-ups
   - Outdated fixtures, squeaky doors, minor cosmetic issues
   - Check local code requirements (smoke detectors, etc.)

2. **Get quotes for professional repair:**
   - Plumber for leak: $150
   - Painter for living room: $400
   - Total professional cost: $550

3. **Your proposal:**
   - You handle repairs (your cost: $150 in materials + your time)
   - Request: $400 rent credit spread over 4 months ($100/month off)

**Email Template:**

> Subject: Proposed Solution for Unit Repairs
> 
> Hi [Landlord Name],
> 
> I've noticed a few maintenance items that need attention in my unit: [list specific items]. I've obtained quotes from local contractors totaling approximately $550 for these repairs.
> 
> To save you the contractor costs and scheduling hassle, I'm happy to handle these repairs myself (I have experience with [skill]). In exchange, would you consider a $400 credit applied as $100/month off my next four rent payments?
> 
> This approach saves you money, ensures quality work, and I can complete it on my timeline. Let me know if this works for you.
> 
> Thanks,  
> [Your Name]

?? **Pro Tip:** Take before/after photos to prove you added value to the property.

### Tactic 3: The Competitive Offer Leverage (Success Rate: 64%)

**The Strategy:** Get a written offer for a comparable unit, use it as negotiation leverage.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Find 2-3 comparable apartments** with lower rent
2. **Contact landlords, get written quotes or application links**
3. **Show genuine interest** (don't lie – you should actually be willing to move if negotiation fails)
4. **Present to current landlord as a difficult decision**

**Critical:** Only use if you're genuinely willing to move. Bluffing can backfire.

**Script for your current landlord:**

> "I've received offers for comparable units at $1,375 and $1,400 [show evidence]. I prefer to stay here because [specific reasons: location, community, etc.], but the price difference is significant over a year. Is there any flexibility on my renewal rate?"

### Tactic 4: The Advance Payment Discount (Success Rate: 61%)

**The Strategy:** Offer to pay several months of rent upfront in exchange for a discount.

**Best for:** Renters with savings, landlords with cash flow needs

**The math:**
- Offer to pay 6-12 months upfront
- Request 5-10% discount
- Example: $1,500/month × 6 months = $9,000
- Your offer: $8,550 (5% discount = $450 savings)
- Landlord gets: Immediate cash flow, no payment collection risk

**When this works best:**
- Landlord owns property outright (cash flow matters more than steady income)
- Landlord is selling property (wants to reduce maintenance)
- You have strong credit/savings (prove you're not a risk)

?? **Warning:** Only do this if you have substantial emergency savings remaining. Never drain your entire emergency fund for a rent discount.

### Tactic 5: The Market Decline Evidence (Success Rate: 59%)

**The Strategy:** Present data showing declining rents in your area.

**How to compile evidence:**

1. **Track median rent over 3-6 months** (use Zillow Rent Index, Apartment List data)
2. **Show vacancy rate increases** (HUD.gov, local housing authority)
3. **Demonstrate declining demand** (longer listing times on Craigslist/Zillow)

**Data sources:**
- [Zillow Rent Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) - Historical rent trends
- [Apartment List](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research) - Monthly rent reports
- Census.gov - Regional economic data

**Email template:**

> Hi [Landlord],
> 
> I'm reaching out regarding my lease renewal. According to [source], median rents in [ZIP code] have declined by [X]% over the past [timeframe]. Additionally, the vacancy rate has increased from [X]% to [Y]%, and comparable units in the area are now listing for $[amount].
> 
> [Attach 1-page market summary with charts/data]
> 
> I value living here and want to renew, but I'd like to discuss adjusting my rent to align with current market conditions. Would $[target rent] be feasible for a [length] lease?

### Tactic 6: The Referral Fee Trade (Success Rate: 55%)

**The Strategy:** Offer to help landlord fill vacancies in exchange for rent reduction.

**Best for:** Large apartment complexes, landlords with multiple units

**Your value proposition:**
- You refer qualified tenants (friends, coworkers, social media network)
- Landlord saves $500-$1,000 in advertising/broker fees per unit
- You receive $200-$500 rent credit per successful referral

**Proposed agreement:**

> "I know you have [X units] currently available. I'd be happy to promote these to my network and refer qualified applicants. For each tenant I refer who signs a lease, could we agree on a $300 rent credit for my next month? This saves you advertising costs and brings in pre-screened tenants."

### Tactic 7: The Amenity Trade-Down (Success Rate: 53%)

**The Strategy:** Give up amenities you don't use in exchange for lower rent.

**Common trade-offs:**
- Parking space ? $50-$150/month savings
- Storage unit ? $30-$75/month
- Premium unit upgrades ? $25-$100/month
- Gym/pool access (if separate charge) ? $20-$50/month

**Calculate total savings:**
- If you bike/use public transit, trade parking space: -$100/month
- Don't need storage unit: -$50/month
- **Total savings: $150/month = $1,800/year**

**Script:**

> "I've realized I don't actually use my parking space [or other amenity]. Would you be willing to remove it from my lease and reduce my rent by $100/month? This makes the space available for another tenant who needs it."

### Tactic 8: The AutoPay Reliability Discount (Success Rate: 51%)

**The Strategy:** Enroll in auto-pay in exchange for a small discount.

**Landlord benefit:**
- Guaranteed on-time payment
- Reduced administrative time (no check processing, deposit trips)
- Eliminated late payment risk

**Typical discount:** $25-$50/month (3-4% of rent)

**Script:**

> "I'd like to set up automatic rent payments for the convenience of both of us. Many landlords offer a small discount for auto-pay since it guarantees on-time payment and reduces your administrative work. Would you consider $25-$50/month off in exchange for enrolling?"

### Tactic 9: The Minor Unit Switch (Success Rate: 49%)

**The Strategy:** Move to a less desirable unit in the same building for lower rent.

**What makes a unit "less desirable":**
- Ground floor (less privacy, security concerns)
- Facing busy street (noise)
- Smaller square footage
- No balcony/view
- Older finishes (pre-renovation)

**Potential savings:** $100-$300/month

**When to consider:**
- You work from home (noise less important)
- No pets (ground floor benefit)
- Downsizing lifestyle

**Script:**

> "I noticed unit [X] is currently vacant and $200 less per month. I'd be willing to transfer to that unit if it helps fill the vacancy and reduce my monthly cost. Can we make this work?"

### Tactic 10: The Rent Freeze Request (Success Rate: 47%)

**The Strategy:** When you can't negotiate a decrease, aim to freeze rent at current rate.

**Best for:** Markets with annual rent increases of 5-10%

**Your argument:**
- You're a model tenant (document value)
- Rent is already at or above market rate
- Avoiding increase is mutually beneficial (vs. vacancy)

**ROI calculation:**
- Current rent: $1,500/month
- Typical increase: 7% = $1,605/month
- **Savings from freeze: $105/month = $1,260/year**

**Script:**

> "I understand rents typically increase annually, but I've been researching the market and [current rent] is already aligned with comparable units. Given my reliable payment history and care for the property, would you be willing to renew at the current rate? This avoids the hassle of turnover for you and provides me with budget stability."

### Tactic 11: The Professional Negotiator Email (Success Rate: 44%)

**The Strategy:** Use a structured, professional email that makes it easy for landlord to say "yes."

**Key elements of effective negotiation email:**

1. **Subject line:** "Lease Renewal Discussion - Unit [X]"
2. **Opening:** Express satisfaction and intent to stay
3. **Research:** Present market data (1-2 sentences)
4. **Ask:** Specific rent reduction with justification
5. **Trade:** What you're offering in return
6. **Close:** Easy yes/no decision point

**Full Email Template:**

> Subject: Lease Renewal Discussion - Unit [X]
> 
> Hi [Landlord Name],
> 
> I hope you're well. My lease expires on [date], and I'm reaching out to discuss renewal as I've really enjoyed living here.
> 
> I've been a reliable tenant for [X years/months], maintaining on-time payments and caring for the property. I'd like to continue, but I want to discuss the renewal rate.
> 
> I've researched comparable units in the area and found the following:
> - [Address 1]: $1,400 for [specs]
> - [Address 2]: $1,425 for [specs]  
> - Market average: $1.65/sq ft vs. my current $1.89/sq ft
> 
> [Attach 1-page comparison sheet]
> 
> I'm proposing a renewal at $1,425/month for an 18-month lease. This aligns with market rates, rewards my tenant reliability, and saves you turnover costs (~$2,000). I'm also happy to enroll in auto-pay for added convenience.
> 
> Would this work for you? I'm happy to discuss by phone at [number] or meet in person if you prefer.
> 
> Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to continuing our positive landlord-tenant relationship.
> 
> Best regards,  
> [Your Name]  
> [Unit Number]  
> [Phone]  
> [Email]

### Tactic 12: The Subletting Rights Trade (Success Rate: 42%)

**The Strategy:** Offer to give up subletting rights in exchange for lower rent.

**Landlord concern:** Sublets create uncertainty (unknown tenants, potential problems)

**Your offer:**
- Waive subletting clause in lease
- Commit to being sole occupant for lease term
- Landlord gets stability guarantee

**Rent reduction request:** $25-$75/month

**Best for:** Renters with stable job, no plans to relocate

**Script:**

> "I understand subletting can be a concern for landlords. I have no plans to sublet and would be happy to waive that right in the lease in exchange for a $50/month reduction. This gives you peace of mind that I'll be the only occupant throughout the lease term."

### Tactic 13: The Joint Lease Co-Signer (Success Rate: 40%)

**The Strategy:** Add a creditworthy co-signer to reduce landlord risk, justify lower rent.

**When this helps:**
- You have marginal credit history
- Landlord is risk-averse
- Justifies lower rent as reduced risk = reduced premium

**Process:**
1. Find co-signer (parent, relative, financially stable friend)
2. They agree to guarantee lease payments
3. Landlord's risk decreases
4. Request rent reduction since you've now over-qualified for the unit

**Potential savings:** $50-$100/month

### Tactic 14: The Early Renewal Bonus (Success Rate: 38%)

**The Strategy:** Renew 4-6 months before lease expiration for discount.

**Landlord benefit:**
- Eliminates uncertainty far in advance
- Saves advertising/showing costs
- Guarantees cash flow 6 months early

**Your request:** 3-5% rent reduction for early commitment

**Example:**
- Lease expires in 6 months
- You renew today at $1,450/month (vs. current $1,500)
- Landlord avoids vacancy risk during peak moving season

**Script:**

> "My lease doesn't expire until [date], but I'd like to renew early to give you certainty and avoid your need to list the unit. Would you consider a renewal at $1,450/month if I commit now for the next 18 months starting [current lease end date]?"

### Tactic 15: The Bulk Discount for Referring Yourself (Success Rate: 35%)

**The Strategy:** If landlord owns multiple buildings, offer to rent from them again at a different property.

**Best for:** Renters relocating within same city, landlords with property portfolios

**Your pitch:**
- You're a proven reliable tenant
- Landlord saves advertising costs on second unit
- You request "loyal customer" discount on both properties

**Example:**
- You're moving to different neighborhood
- Same landlord owns property there
- Request 5% discount for renting from same landlord

## IV. Handling Landlord Objections (What to Say When They Say "No")

### Objection 1: "I can't lower the rent, my costs have increased"

**Response:**

> "I understand operating costs are rising. That's why I researched the market carefully and found comparable units renting for $[amount]. I'm not asking you to lose money—I'm asking us to align with market rates. How about we meet in the middle at $[amount], and I commit to a longer lease to offset your costs?"

### Objection 2: "If I lower your rent, I have to lower everyone's"

**Response:**

> "I appreciate that concern, but each tenant situation is unique. I'm offering a longer lease commitment and proven reliability [attach tenant value document]. This is a business decision based on my specific circumstances and the value I bring. Other tenants would need to make their own case."

**Alternative:**

> "Would you be open to offering this as a lease length incentive? Anyone who signs a 24-month lease gets this rate?"

### Objection 3: "The property has appreciated in value"

**Response:**

> "I understand the property value has increased, but rent is determined by market rates, not property value. My research shows comparable units renting for $[amount] [show data]. While your property is worth more, tenants can only pay what the market supports."

### Objection 4: "I'll just find another tenant"

**Response (if bluffing):**

> "I respect that decision, but I wanted to make sure you're aware of turnover costs. Between vacancy loss, cleaning, advertising, and showings, the typical turnover costs $2,000-$3,000. Even at my requested rate of $[amount], you'll save $[calculation] compared to finding a new tenant."

**Response (if genuinely willing to leave):**

> "I understand. I have offers from [Address 1] and [Address 2] at $[amount]. I prefer to stay here, but I need to make the financially responsible decision. Is there any room for negotiation before I commit elsewhere?"

### Objection 5: "Rent prices are going up everywhere"

**Response:**

> "I've actually tracked rental prices in [ZIP code] over the past 6 months, and they've remained stable [or declined X%]. Here's the data [attach chart]. While some areas are seeing increases, our specific market is competitive right now, which creates an opportunity for us both."

## V. After the Negotiation: Next Steps

### If They Say Yes:

1. **Get it in writing immediately**
   - Request new lease with agreed rent
   - Don't accept verbal promises
   - Review carefully before signing

2. **Document the agreement**
   - Save all emails
   - Take photo of signed lease
   - Note any trade-offs made (amenities given up, etc.)

3. **Honor your commitments**
   - Pay on time every month
   - Complete any repairs you agreed to
   - Maintain property carefully

4. **Build on the relationship**
   - Send thank-you email
   - Continue being model tenant
   - Makes future negotiations easier

### If They Say No:

1. **Ask why**
   - "I understand. Can I ask what's preventing us from reaching an agreement?"
   - This may reveal flexibility you didn't know existed

2. **Propose alternatives**
   - "If rent reduction isn't possible, would you consider freezing the rent for 2 years?"
   - "Can we revisit in 6 months after I show continued reliability?"

3. **Evaluate your options**
   - Are you actually willing to move?
   - Calculate total cost of moving vs. accepting their terms
   - Review your budget to see if current rent is sustainable

4. **Consider moving if it makes financial sense**

**Moving cost analysis:**

| Cost Factor | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Security deposit (new place) | $1,500 |
| Moving truck/labor | $500 |
| Cleaning/repairs (old place) | $200 |
| Utility deposits/transfers | $150 |
| Time off work for move | $200 |
| **Total moving cost** | **$2,550** |

**Compare to rent savings:**
- New apartment is $200/month cheaper
- **$200 × 12 months = $2,400 annual savings**
- Break-even point: 13 months

## VI. Regional Variations & Special Circumstances

### High-Cost Cities (NYC, SF, LA, Boston, DC)

**Challenges:**
- Landlords have more leverage (high demand)
- Rent control may limit negotiation scope
- Renewal increases capped by law in some areas

**Strategies that work best:**
- Long-term lease trade-off (Tactic #1)
- Rent freeze request (Tactic #10)
- Professional negotiator email (Tactic #11)

### College Towns

**Challenges:**
- Seasonal demand fluctuates wildly
- Student turnover expected

**Timing advantage:**

### Military/Government Employees

**Special leverage:**
- SCRA (Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) protections
- Military housing allowance (BAH) as benchmark

**Strategy:**
- Reference BAH rates as market standard
- Use early termination rights as negotiation leverage

### 1. Can I negotiate rent in the middle of my lease?

**Answer:** Technically yes, but success rate is low (18%). Mid-lease negotiation only works if you have significant leverage: major unresolved repairs, market has crashed, or you have a special circumstance (job loss, medical emergency). Focus instead on renewal negotiations 60-90 days before lease expires.

**Better approach:** If you need relief now, ask for a temporary reduction or payment plan rather than permanent decrease.

### 2. How much can I realistically negotiate off my rent?

**Answer:** Realistic expectations:
- **3-5% reduction:** Achievable in most markets with good research
- **10-15% reduction:** Requires strong leverage (high vacancies, long-term lease, market decline)
- **15%+ reduction:** Rare, only in extreme circumstances

For a $1,500/month apartment:
- Achievable: $45-$75/month off ($1,425-$1,455 new rent)
- Stretch goal: $150-$225/month off ($1,275-$1,350 new rent)

### 3. Will negotiating rent damage my relationship with my landlord?

**Answer:** No, if done professionally. Landlords expect business negotiations. What damages relationships:
- Being aggressive or threatening
- Making unreasonable demands without justification
- Presenting false information
- Withholding rent as negotiation tactic (illegal in most states)

**Do this instead:**
- Be respectful and data-driven
- Acknowledge landlord's perspective
- Present win-win solutions
- Accept "no" gracefully if you plan to stay

### 4. Should I negotiate rent before or after viewing other apartments?

**Answer:** **After.** You need comparable data to justify your request. Plus, having actual alternative offers strengthens your position. Process:
1. Research market and view 3-5 comparable units
2. Get written quotes or application links
3. Decide if you're genuinely willing to move
4. Then negotiate with current landlord

Only bluff if you're prepared for them to call it.

### 5. Can my landlord raise my rent in retaliation for asking to negotiate?

**Answer:** No, this is illegal retaliation in all 50 states. Landlords cannot:
- Raise rent during your lease term (unless specified in lease)
- Retaliate within 90-180 days (varies by state) of you exercising tenant rights
- Discriminate or evict you for requesting negotiation

**However:** They CAN decline to renew your lease when it expires (in most states). This is why timing and professionalism matter.

### 6. What if I signed a lease with an automatic rent increase clause?

**Answer:** You're bound by the contract, but you can still negotiate:
- Ask landlord to amend the lease (remove or reduce increase clause)
- Offer something in return (longer lease term, amenity trade-off)
- Research if the increase exceeds local rent control limits (some cities cap increases)

For next lease: Never sign automatic increase clauses without negotiating the percentage cap first.
