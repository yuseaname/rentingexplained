## Key takeaways

- Legal exits exist, but they depend on your state and documentation.
- Always put requests and agreements in writing.
- Habitability issues require a specific notice process.
- A replacement tenant can be the simplest solution.
- A calm, clear plan helps protect your credit.

## Start with your lease and local rules

Your lease often lists notice requirements and early termination options. Before acting, check your state rules at the [tenant rights and laws hub](/laws). If you want help spotting tricky clauses, use the [Lease Red Flag Scanner](/tools/lease-red-flag-scanner).

## Legal reasons that may allow penalty-free exit

These vary by state, but common categories include:

### Uninhabitable conditions

If the unit is unsafe and the landlord fails to fix it after proper notice, you may have a legal path to leave. Document everything and follow your state process.

### Domestic violence protections

Many states provide early termination protections for survivors. The requirements are specific, so review your local rules before taking action.

### Military orders

Federal protections can apply for service members with qualifying orders. If this applies to you, follow the notice and documentation steps carefully.

For broader context, see the [tenant rights guide](/blog/tenant-rights-everyone-should-know).

## Documentation checklist

Good documentation is what turns a claim into a defensible exit.

- Send repair requests in writing.
- Keep copies of emails, letters, and notices.
- Save photos and videos with timestamps.
- Record dates of conversations and visits.

## A simple notice template

Use this as a starting point. Adjust to your situation and state rules.

```
Subject: Written Notice Regarding Unit Conditions at [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

I am writing to document a serious issue in the unit at [address]. The issue is [describe the problem] and has been ongoing since [date].

I am requesting repairs by [reasonable date]. If the issue is not resolved by then, I will need to follow the legal process available in my state.

Please confirm receipt of this notice and your repair timeline.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

## If you do not have a legal exit

If none of the above applies, you can still reduce risk.

### Ask about a replacement tenant

If your lease allows assignment or subletting, ask for the exact process in writing. This is often the least expensive option.

### Negotiate an early termination agreement

A simple agreement can set a move-out date, a payment plan, and a release from future obligations. Keep it in writing.

## Protecting your credit

Credit issues usually come from unpaid balances, collections, or judgments. Communicate early, keep records, and avoid leaving without a written plan.

If you are unsure about total costs, compare scenarios with the [Hidden Fees Estimator](/tools/hidden-fees-estimator) before deciding.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can my landlord refuse to let me leave?

If there is no legal reason, landlords can enforce the lease. That is why negotiation and documentation matter.

### What if the landlord ignores repair requests?

Follow your state notice process and document everything. You may need local housing resources to confirm violations.

### Can I leave without paying anything?

Only if you meet a legal exemption or the landlord agrees in writing.
