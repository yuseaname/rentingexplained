Breaking a lease is stressful, but there are safer paths if you slow down and follow the rules. This guide is general information, not legal advice. Laws vary by state and city, so confirm local rules before acting.

<h2 id="start-with-lease">Start with your lease and local rules</h2>

Your lease usually lists notice requirements, fees, and early termination clauses. Start there, then confirm state and local rules at the [tenant rights and laws hub](/laws) or the [state overview guide](/blog/tenant-rights-by-state-overview).

If you want help spotting tricky clauses, use the [Lease Red Flag Scanner](/tools/lease-red-flag-scanner).

<h2 id="legal-reasons">Common legal reasons for early exit</h2>

The exact rules vary by state, but these categories are common. Always follow your local notice process.

### Uninhabitable conditions

If the unit is unsafe and the landlord does not fix it after proper notice, you may have a legal path to leave. Document the issue and keep copies of notices.

### Domestic violence protections

Many states provide early termination protections for survivors. Requirements are specific, so review local rules and documentation needs.

### Military orders

Federal protections can apply for service members with qualifying orders. Follow the notice and documentation steps carefully.

### Other state-specific protections

Some states include protections for health issues, harassment, or code violations. Verify the exact requirements locally.

<h2 id="document-everything">Document everything</h2>

Good documentation is what turns a claim into a defensible exit.

- Send repair requests in writing.
- Keep copies of emails, letters, and notices.
- Save photos and videos with timestamps.
- Record dates of conversations and visits.

<h2 id="send-notice">Send a clear notice</h2>

Use a short, factual notice that states the issue, your request, and your timeline.

```
Subject: Written Notice Regarding Unit Conditions at [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

I am writing to document a serious issue in the unit at [address]. The issue is [describe the problem] and has been ongoing since [date].

I am requesting repairs by [reasonable date]. If the issue is not resolved by then, I will need to follow the legal process available in my state.

Please confirm receipt of this notice and your repair timeline.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

Warning: Do not stop paying rent or move out without following the required notice steps. That can create avoidable risk.

<h2 id="no-legal-exit">If you do not have a legal exit</h2>

You can still reduce risk by using a negotiated or replacement path.

### Ask about a replacement tenant

If your lease allows assignment or subletting, ask for the exact process in writing. This is often the least expensive option.

### Negotiate an early termination agreement

A short agreement can set a move-out date, a payment plan, and a release from future obligations. Keep it in writing.

<h2 id="protect-credit">Protect your credit and costs</h2>

Credit issues usually come from unpaid balances, collections, or judgments. Communicate early, keep records, and avoid leaving without a written plan.

If you need to compare potential costs, use the [Hidden Fees Estimator](/tools/hidden-fees-estimator) to map the total monthly impact.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

### Can my landlord refuse to let me leave?

If there is no legal reason, landlords can enforce the lease. That is why negotiation and documentation matter.

### What if the landlord ignores repair requests?

Follow your state notice process and document everything. Local housing resources can help confirm violations.

### Can I leave without paying anything?

Only if you meet a legal exemption or the landlord agrees in writing. Otherwise, plan for an agreed payment or replacement tenant.

### Will breaking my lease hurt my credit?

It can if unpaid balances go to collections. A written agreement reduces the risk.
