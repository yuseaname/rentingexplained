# Apartment Move-Out Checklist: Photos, Cleaning, Utilities

Moving out is where most deposit problems start. The fix is not a perfect clean, it is a clear plan: document the unit, finish the basics, and leave a paper trail.

This guide is general information, not legal advice. Use it as a practical checklist for your next move-out.

<h2 id="timeline">Move-out timeline in three phases</h2>

A timeline keeps the work small and manageable.

### Phase 1: Two to four weeks out

- Give notice on time. Use the [notice to vacate template](/blog/notice-to-vacate-letter-template).
- Schedule a walkthrough if your landlord allows one.
- Start a move-out folder for photos and receipts.

If you are leaving before your lease ends, review [breaking a lease without penalty](/blog/breaking-a-lease-without-penalty-2025) so you understand the extra steps.

### Phase 2: One week out

- Take "before" photos and video.
- Patch small nail holes if allowed.
- Clean the biggest surfaces first: floors, kitchen, and bathroom.

Example: Jordan schedules photos on Saturday, cleans on Sunday, and does the walkthrough on Monday. The staggered plan keeps the last two days calm.
### Phase 3: Move-out day

- Take final photos and video after cleaning.
- Return keys the way your lease requires.
- Save proof of return and any walkthrough notes.

<h2 id="photos-video">Photos and video: your deposit armor</h2>

Photos and video protect you if there is a dispute. You do not need fancy gear, just a calm walkthrough.

### What to photograph

- Every room, from multiple angles
- Floors, counters, and appliances
- Inside cabinets, closets, and the fridge
- Any existing scratches or stains

Pro tip: Turn on all the lights and open curtains before you start.

### How to label files

Use simple names like "Kitchen-1" or "Bedroom-Closet." This makes it easier to match photos to any later questions.

<h2 id="cleaning">Cleaning checklist: what matters most</h2>

Focus on the areas landlords usually inspect. Perfect is not required, but visible grime can lead to deductions.

### High-impact cleaning tasks

- Kitchen: stove, oven door, sink, and counters
- Bathroom: shower walls, toilet base, mirror, and sink
- Floors: vacuum or mop, especially corners
- Trash: remove all bags and leftovers

Warning: Leaving a few trash bags behind can trigger removal fees.

<h2 id="room-by-room">Room-by-room checklist highlights</h2>

Use this quick list to prioritize the most common inspection areas.

### Kitchen

- Wipe cabinets, counters, and backsplash.
- Clean inside the fridge and freezer.
- Remove grease from the stovetop and hood.

### Bathroom

- Clean the shower walls and tub line.
- Wipe the vanity and mirror.
- Check for hair or debris around drains.

### Bedroom and living room

- Vacuum baseboards and corners.
- Patch small holes if allowed.
- Remove all personal items from closets.

### Entryway and balcony (if applicable)

- Sweep entry floors and wipe door surfaces.
- Remove any personal items from balconies or patios.

Pro tip: Take photos before and after cleaning to show the full timeline of work.
<h2 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough day: what to bring and ask</h2>

A walkthrough gives you a chance to note issues and confirm expectations.

### Bring these items

- Your move-out photos and video
- A copy of your lease
- A checklist of cleaned areas

### Ask for this in writing

- Any noted damages or deductions
- The deposit return address
- The expected timeline for the statement

If your landlord does not do walkthroughs, document everything yourself and save the files.

Warning: Do not rely on verbal walkthrough comments. Get any notes in writing if possible.

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities and services: cancel or transfer</h2>

Utilities can cause surprise bills after you move out if they are not canceled.

### Common utilities to handle

- Electricity and gas
- Water or trash (if billed separately)
- Internet and cable
- Renter insurance policy updates

Use the [apartment utility costs guide](/blog/apartment-utility-costs) for a quick checklist of what to cancel or transfer.

Pro tip: Ask for a final meter reading or confirmation email from the utility provider when possible. It helps if a bill shows up after you leave.
If you are unsure about the exact shutoff date, schedule it for the day after you move out so you do not lose service early.

<h2 id="move-out-kit">Move-out day kit</h2>

Having a small kit on move-out day keeps you from scrambling for basic supplies.

### Helpful items to bring

- Trash bags, paper towels, and a basic cleaner
- A flashlight for closets and under sinks
- Spackle and a small putty knife (if allowed)
- Extra light bulbs and batteries
- Phone charger and a backup marker for labels

Pro tip: Keep receipts for any supplies you buy in case the landlord asks for proof of repairs.
Label boxes as you pack so you can clean faster.
<h2 id="keys">Keys, access, and final proof</h2>

Keys are the last step and one of the easiest to document.

### How to return keys

Follow your lease instructions. If you drop keys in a box or mail them, take a photo of the return and save a timestamped receipt.

If you have multiple keys, fobs, or parking passes, write down what you returned and when. A short list protects you if something goes missing.

### Confirm forwarding address

Your security deposit and statement should go to your forwarding address. If you need a template for follow-up, see [security deposits and evictions](/blog/security-deposits-and-evictions-overview).

<h2 id="in-writing">Communicate in writing</h2>

Written communication prevents misunderstandings and gives you a record if anything goes sideways.

### What to put in writing

- Your move-out date and key return method
- Your forwarding address
- Any agreements about repairs or cleaning

### How to keep it simple

Send short messages that include dates and facts. Save screenshots of any portal confirmations.

Pro tip: If you had a walkthrough, ask for a quick written summary of any issues noted.

If you agree to any repairs or fees, ask the landlord to confirm the amount and reason in writing so there are no surprises on the final statement.

<h2 id="common-deductions">Common deductions and how to avoid them</h2>

Landlords often deduct for a few predictable reasons. These steps reduce the risk.

### Cleaning deductions

Focus on the oven, refrigerator, and bathroom grout. These are the most common items noted on move-out statements.

If your lease mentions professional carpet cleaning, confirm whether it is required or optional. Keep any receipts you have in case the landlord asks for proof.

### Trash and leftover items

Remove all belongings, including items in closets and under sinks. Even a small leftover pile can trigger a haul-away fee.

### Missing keys or access fobs

Return every key, fob, and garage opener. If something is missing, ask for the replacement cost in writing so you can compare it to the statement later.

<h2 id="after-move-out">After move-out: track your deposit</h2>

After you turn in keys, track the deposit timeline and keep your documentation together.

### Save the statement

The itemized statement is the key record of deductions. Save it with your photos and move-out notes.

### Follow up if needed

If the timeline has passed, use the [security deposit return timeline guide](/blog/security-deposit-return-timeline) for a calm follow-up plan.

### Keep a simple timeline log

Write down the move-out date, key return date, and the date you sent your forwarding address. If you follow up, keep those emails in the same folder.
