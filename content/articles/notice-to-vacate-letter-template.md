# Notice to Vacate Letter Template: What to Include

Giving notice to move out should be simple, but most renters worry about missing a detail that costs them money later. The good news: a notice to vacate letter is just a short, clear statement with the right dates and a few key details.

This guide is general information, not legal advice. Notice rules vary by state and by lease, so always check your lease and local rules before you send your letter.

## Key takeaways

- A notice to vacate is a short, written heads-up with the right dates.
- The deadline matters more than the format.
- Include your move-out date, unit address, and forwarding address.
- Send it in writing and keep proof of delivery.
- If you are leaving early, compare your options first.

## Read your lease and the notice timeline

Your lease usually says how much notice you need to give. That might be a set number of days before the lease ends or a specific day of the month. The timeline is the most important part of your letter.

### Where to find the notice requirement

Look for sections labeled "Notice to Vacate," "Termination," or "Renewal." If anything is unclear, ask your landlord for a written explanation.

Warning: Do not assume the deadline. Missing the notice date can extend your lease or trigger extra charges.

### A quick example

Example: Taylor's lease ends on May 31. The lease requires a written notice by April 30. Taylor sends the notice by email on April 20 and keeps the confirmation. This keeps the move-out date clear and avoids a surprise month-to-month renewal.

## What to include in a notice to vacate letter

A good notice is short and complete. This list covers the essentials most landlords need.

### Required details

- Your full name and any co-tenants on the lease.
- The rental address and unit number.
- The date you are writing the notice.
- Your intended move-out date.
- A forwarding address for the deposit return.

Pro tip: Include your phone number and email so the landlord can confirm the walkthrough or key return.

### Move-out date clarity

Write the exact move-out date, not just the month. If your lease ends on the last day of the month, state that date in full so there is no confusion.
### Forwarding address tips

- Use a full mailing address, including apartment number if needed.
- If you do not know the address yet, state when you will provide it and send a follow-up in writing.
- Keep a copy of the address confirmation in your move-out folder.

### Optional but helpful details

- A request for a move-out walkthrough.
- A note about how you will return keys.
- A reminder to send your security deposit statement to your forwarding address.

## Timing mistakes to avoid

Most problems come from timing, not wording. Watch out for these common errors.

### Sending the notice too late

If your lease requires notice before a certain date, late notice can roll you into another month or a higher month-to-month rate.

### Forgetting the delivery method

Some leases require written notice by email, mail, or a portal. Follow the required method and keep a copy.

### Ignoring renewal timing

If you are moving out instead of renewing, compare the options in the [rent increase renewal guide](/blog/rent-increase-renewal-guide). It helps you decide whether moving is worth the total cost.

## Delivery options and proof

How you deliver the notice matters because it creates your proof.
### Email notice

Email is common and fast. Save the sent email and any reply. If your lease allows email notice, this is often the simplest method.

### Certified or tracked mail

If your lease requires mail, send the letter with tracking and keep the receipt. The tracking number is your proof of delivery.

### Portal submissions

If your landlord uses a portal, submit the notice there and take a screenshot of the confirmation page.

Warning: A phone call is not enough. Always send a written notice so there is a record.

If you hand-deliver a notice, ask for a signed receipt or follow up with an email confirming delivery.

## Roommates and co-tenants: who should sign

If you share the lease, your notice should match the lease structure.

### Everyone on the lease should be included

List all leaseholders in the notice so the landlord knows the full unit is ending the lease. If only one person is leaving, ask the landlord about a replacement or a lease change in writing.

### Decide who sends it

Pick one person to send the notice and keep the proof. A single clear notice avoids confusion.

### If one roommate is staying

If one person wants to stay, the landlord may require a new application or a lease addendum. That is different from a normal notice, so get the requirements in writing.

## Step-by-step: how to send your notice

Use this quick process so your notice is clear and documented.

1) Draft your notice using the checklist below.
2) Confirm the deadline and delivery method in your lease.
3) Send the notice and save proof (email confirmation, certified mail receipt, or portal screenshot).
4) Ask for a written confirmation from your landlord.

## Final rent and prorated charges

Your last rent payment can be different from your usual amount. It depends on your move-out date and how your lease handles proration.
### Ask about final billing

If you are moving mid-month, ask how the final rent will be calculated and when it is due. Keep any confirmation in writing.

### Watch for extra move-out fees

Some leases include move-out fees or cleaning charges. Confirm those in advance so they are not a surprise. The [Hidden Fees Estimator](/tools/hidden-fees-estimator) can help you see the true total.

## After you send notice: next steps

Once the notice is sent, shift to move-out preparation. A short checklist keeps you on track.

### Schedule your move-out walkthrough

If your landlord offers a walkthrough, schedule it early. It gives you time to fix small issues before move-out.

### Start the move-out checklist

Use the [move-out checklist](/blog/apartment-move-out-checklist) for photos, cleaning, and key return steps.

### Clarify key return and access

Ask how keys, fobs, and garage openers should be returned. If there is a drop box or office handoff, document the time and date so you have proof.

### Plan utilities and services

Use the [apartment utility costs guide](/blog/apartment-utility-costs) to cancel or transfer utilities so you do not get billed after you leave.

### Update renters insurance

If you are moving to a new place, update your policy or compare rates using the [renters insurance cost guide](/blog/renters-insurance-cost-2025).

## Copy/Paste Template: Notice to Vacate Letter

**When to use this:** When you are ending your lease at the normal end date and need a clean written notice.

![Person drafting a letter on a laptop](/images/legal-rights/notice-to-vacate-letter-template/notice-to-vacate-draft.webp)

```text
Subject: Notice to Vacate - [Address]

Hi [Landlord Name],

This is my written notice that I will be moving out of [Address, Unit #]. My intended move-out date is [Move-Out Date], which is in line with my lease notice requirements.

Please send any move-out instructions and the security deposit statement to my forwarding address:
[Forwarding Address]

I am available for a move-out walkthrough on [Preferred Dates/Times]. Please confirm the process for returning keys.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[Phone Number]
[Email Address]
```

**Make it yours:** Keep the tone short and professional. Clear dates and a forwarding address matter most.

## If you are moving early vs ending normally

Leaving early is different from a normal notice. It can trigger fees or special rules, depending on your lease.

### Moving out early

If you are leaving before your lease ends, review [breaking a lease without penalty](/blog/breaking-a-lease-without-penalty-2025) first. It explains common options and the documentation that helps.

### Moving out at lease end

If you are ending the lease as planned, your main goal is to deliver notice on time and prepare for your move-out checklist.

If you want a room-by-room plan, use the [move-out checklist](/blog/apartment-move-out-checklist) to protect your deposit.

Pro tip: If you are setting up a new place, compare renters insurance options early so coverage starts on move-in day. Disclosure: We may earn a commission if you use this service (at no cost to you).
