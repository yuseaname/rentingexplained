These are representative competitor types to benchmark against:
- Aggregators (Apartments.com, Zillow) — broad, template-like
- Legal sites (Nolo, LegalZoom) — accurate but less actionable
- Lifestyle sites (Apartment Therapy, The Spruce) — not renter-finance focused

**Differentiation:** scripts + calculators + decision trees + renter-first tone.
