        Your first apartment is exciting and a little overwhelming. It is also the moment many renters accidentally
        overspend: you want the place to feel “done” immediately, so you buy everything at once and then realize you
        still have utility setup fees, deposits, and a grocery budget to cover.

        This guide is general information, not financial or legal advice. It is designed to help you avoid expensive

      <h2 id="what-landlords-provide">Before you buy: what landlords usually provide</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The fastest way to waste money is buying something your unit already includes. Before you buy appliances, safety
        items, or big furniture, confirm what is already in the unit and what is in shared areas (laundry rooms,
        storage, parking).
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        If your lease or tour notes are unclear, ask the property manager in writing so you have a record. For general
        renter protections and what leases typically cover, see{' '}
        <a href="/blog/tenant-rights-everyone-should-know" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-medium">
          tenant rights basics
        </a>
        . (This is educational information; local rules vary.)
      </p>

      <h3>Common “already included” items</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Major appliances like a stove and refrigerator (varies by unit).</li>
        <li>Heating and hot water systems.</li>
        <li>Smoke detectors (and sometimes carbon monoxide detectors).</li>
        <li>Window coverings, light fixtures, or ceiling fans (varies).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to confirm before you shop</h3>
      <ol className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Read the lease section on landlord-provided items and included utilities.</li>
        <li>Do a detailed move-in walkthrough with a checklist and photos.</li>
        <li>Ask about shared areas: laundry, storage, parking, trash, and mail/package rules.</li>
        <li>Document condition with photos/video on day one.</li>

      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Furniture is optional in the short term. Move-in costs are not. Before you set a shopping budget, list the
        expenses you must pay to get the keys and keep the unit running during month one.

      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>First month’s rent (and sometimes last month).</li>

        Deposits are one of the biggest sources of stress for first-time renters, and many disputes come down to one
        thing: documentation. If you do nothing else on move-in day, take clear photos/video and keep them organized.

      <h2 id="utilities-setup">Utilities and setup checklist</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        First apartments often come with “admin tasks” that do not feel urgent until the day you need internet, power,
        or a working mailbox. A simple setup checklist keeps you from scrambling.
      </p>
      <h3>Before move-in (or week one)</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Confirm what utilities are included vs renter-paid.</li>
        <li>Set up electricity/gas/water accounts if required.</li>
        <li>Plan internet setup and install timing.</li>
        <li>Ask how packages are handled (locker, office pickup, delivery rules).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Keep a paper trail</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Save confirmation emails for any account setup and keep a simple list of login info. This matters later if you
        need proof of a transfer date or billing period.
      </p>

      <h2 id="room-by-room">Room-by-room essentials (buy these first)</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        The goal is not to fill your apartment. The goal is to cover sleep, hygiene, simple meals, and basic cleaning so
        you feel stable in week one. Upgrades can wait until you understand the space.
      </p>

      <h3>Bedroom (protect sleep first)</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Mattress and basic bedding (sheets, blanket/comforter, pillow).</li>
        <li>Simple lighting you can control (lamp or bulb).</li>
        <li>A laundry plan (hamper/bag and detergent).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bathroom (hygiene + prevention)</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Shower curtain and liner (if needed), towels, and bath mat.</li>
        <li>Basic cleaning supplies (toilet brush, multi-surface cleaner).</li>
        <li>A plunger (buy it before you need it).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Kitchen (minimum viable setup)</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>One pot, one pan, one baking sheet (or your equivalent basics).</li>
        <li>Cutting board and a basic knife.</li>
        <li>A few plates/bowls, cups, utensils, and food storage.</li>
        <li>Dish soap, sponge/brush, and trash bags.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Living room (function first)</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Seating you will actually use (even temporary is fine).</li>
        <li>A small surface that works for meals or tasks.</li>
        <li>Lighting that makes the space usable at night.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cleaning and safety basics</h3>
      <ul className="text-gray-700">
        <li>Trash bags, paper towels, and a multi-surface cleaner.</li>
        <li>Vacuum or broom depending on your floors.</li>
        <li>A basic tool kit for small fixes (screwdriver, measuring tape).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="first-week">First-week setup plan (keep it calm)</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        A simple plan prevents “stress shopping.” Your first week should focus on documenting the unit, setting up
        essentials, and learning what the apartment needs.
      </p>
      <ol className="text-gray-700">
        <li>
          <strong>Day 1:</strong> Take photos/video, note existing issues, and save everything in one folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Day 2:</strong> Set up sleep (bed + bedding) and basic bathroom items so you can rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Days 3–7:</strong> Build a minimal kitchen setup and basic cleaning routine, then stop buying until you
          know what is missing.

      <h2 id="shopping-without-overspending">How to shop without overspending</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Most first-apartment overspending is not one big mistake. It is stacking small purchases: delivery fees,
        duplicate kitchen gadgets, and “temporary” items that get replaced immediately.
      </p>

      <h3>Measure first, buy second</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Measure doorways, hallways, and the space where an item will live. A great deal is not a deal if it does not fit
        or blocks your layout. Keep a note with key measurements so you are not guessing while shopping.
      </p>

      <h3>Watch delivery and assembly costs</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Delivery and assembly fees can quietly add up. Compare the all-in cost, not just the sticker price. If you are
        buying used, include pickup costs in your decision.
      </p>

      <h3>Avoid duplicates and “fantasy self” purchases</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Buy for your real routines, not your ideal routines. If you do not cook often now, start with a minimal kitchen
        setup and add items only when you find yourself needing them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="timeline">A simple 3-month buying timeline</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Upgrading in phases keeps costs predictable and helps you learn what the apartment actually needs.
      </p>

      <h3>Month 1: essentials only</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">Cover sleep, hygiene, basic meals, and basic cleaning. Skip decor and upgrades.</p>

      <h3>Month 2: comfort upgrades</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Add items that reduce daily friction: storage, better lighting, a small desk, or improved seating.
      </p>

      <h3>Month 3: optional extras</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Upgrade only after you have paid at least one full month of bills in the new place. The first utility bill can
        change what “affordable” feels like.

      <h2 id="common-mistakes">Common first-apartment mistakes (and how to avoid them)</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Most first-apartment mistakes are normal. They happen when you move fast, buy emotionally, or assume “base rent”
        is the full cost. These quick fixes keep the move-in calm.

      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What should I buy first for my first apartment?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Start with what keeps you stable: a basic bed setup, bathroom essentials, and a minimal kitchen kit. Those three
        categories cover sleep, hygiene, and food, which makes the first week feel manageable. After that, add cleaning
        supplies and simple storage. Decor and upgrades can wait until you have lived in the space and know what you
        actually need.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I avoid overspending in the first week?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Set a short list of essentials and stop shopping once the list is complete. Most overspending comes from
        duplicates, delivery fees, and buying for an ideal routine you do not actually have. Measure your space before
        buying anything large and wait a couple of weeks before upgrading. A staged plan is usually cheaper than buying
        everything at once.
      </p>

      <h3>Should I buy used furniture for my first apartment?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Used can be a great way to save money, especially for tables, chairs, and storage pieces. Inspect carefully,
        measure before pickup, and avoid items you cannot clean or test. For health and safety, many renters prefer to
        buy mattresses and bedding new. If a used item feels risky, it is okay to start smaller and upgrade later.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I document at move-in?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Document the condition of the unit on day one: wide shots of each room, close-ups of existing wear, and photos
        of appliances and fixtures. Save the photos with dates and keep them in one folder. If you report issues, do it
        in writing and keep copies. Clear documentation helps prevent disputes later, especially around deposits.
      </p>

      <h3>How do I know if rent fits my budget before I buy anything?</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700">
        Start by calculating a realistic rent range based on your cash flow, not just a rule of thumb. Then add the
        recurring fees and utilities that make up your true monthly total. The{' '}
